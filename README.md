# WeatherTest
This Android/Kotlin project calls OpenWeatherAPI to display the current weather as well as 16 day forecast. 
Some Features:
1) calls Mapquest API's to perform Geocoding and Reverse-Geocoding (Google charges $$)
2) calls Googles mapping API to display maps in the background.
3) employs Android's new Architecture components to (Room, ViewModel, LiveData) to help with persistance of the data and reduce 
unnecessary network calls.
4) Uses RxJava to define observers and observables along with retrofit for network calls as well as some UI event handling.

The project evolved overtime as I decided to build on it using some the latest technologies. There is some tech debt/code clean
that could be applied to the project.

If this helps in your quest for knowledge, please let me know.

Thanks!

Gary
